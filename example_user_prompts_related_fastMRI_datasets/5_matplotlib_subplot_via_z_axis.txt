The code starts by defining file paths: 
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` located at fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 for an HDF5 file containing brain MRI data 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` where the path is sub group path is 100099070170/279 where the dataset fastMRI_brain_data is located to access the brain MRI data within the HDF5 file.

Also print the below information by acessing attributes data from the metadata sub group from the group FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279 
Patient age, Patient BirthDate, Patient id, Patient_Identity_Removed, Patientname, Sex

It then loads the HDF5 file in read mode and extracts the brain MRI data from the file. 
The extracted 2D dataset, representing a slice of the brain MRI volume, is assigned to `brain_vol`.

The code reshapes the 2D dataset into a 3D array, where each slice of the brain MRI volume is represented by a 2D array. 
This is done to group every 512 columns into slices.

Next, it plots the coronal plane of the brain MRI volume using matplotlib. 
It defines the number of rows and columns for the plot, calculates the step size to iterate over the slices, 
and creates a figure with subplots. Each slice is rotated by 270 degrees using scipy.ndimage and displayed in a subplot with the axis turned off.

It sets the values of fig and axs from subplots of fig_rows, fig_cols, and fig_size of values 15 and 31

Set the fig_rows and fig_cols to 4, then calculate the n_subplots by multiplying fig_rows and fig_cols, calculates step_size dividing n_slice by n_subplots,
then calculates plot_range by multiplying n_subplots and step_size, then it calculates start_stop from the difference of n_slice and plot_range and divides by 2

The program creates a figure with multiple subplots by using a loop by enumerating from the range of start_stop to plot_range by increasing by step_size,
set imshow by slicing data from the z axis,

Finally, the code displays the plot. The goal is to load brain MRI data from an HDF5 file, reshape it into a 3D array, 
and visualize the coronal plane of the brain MRI volume.
