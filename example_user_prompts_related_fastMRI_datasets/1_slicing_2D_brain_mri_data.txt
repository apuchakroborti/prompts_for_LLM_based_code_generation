The code starts by defining two constants: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` (the path to the HDF5 file) which is located at fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` (the path within the HDF5 file where the brain volume data is stored) 
which read from FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT root group, 
sub group is 100099070170 and immediate parent sub-group is 279 and dataset is fastMRI_brain_data.

Also print the below information by acessing attributes data from the metadata sub group from the group FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279 
Patient age, Patient BirthDate, Patient id, Patient_Identity_Removed, Patientname, Sex

It then opens the HDF5 file in read mode, accessing the brain volume data by navigating to the specified path FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH. 
It reads all data along all axes, storing it in the `brain_vol` variable.

The code prints information about the `brain_vol` data and visualizes a slice through different planes of the brain volume data using image plots. 
Specifically, it creates plots of bone map (a slice from 10 to 502 from both the rows and columns) , using indexing to select specific slices from the 2D array.
