The code starts by defining file paths and variables. 
It imports necessary libraries and defines two file paths: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is located at fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 for an HDF5 file containing brain MRI data, 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` for the path within the HDF5 file where the brain MRI data is stored.

The code reads the HDF5 file, assigning it to a variable `f`. Within the `with` block, 
it reads the brain MRI data from the HDF5 file using the defined `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH`, 
which is stored within a group named FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT --> /100099070170 --> /279 --> where the dataset is fastMRI_brain_data 
The data is assigned to a variable `brain_vol`.

Also print the below information by acessing attributes data from the metadata sub group from the group FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279 
Patient age, Patient BirthDate, Patient id, Patient_Identity_Removed, Patientname, Sex

The code then reshapes the 2D dataset into a 3D array with shape `(16, 32, 512)`, representing 16 slices, each with 32 rows and 512 columns. 
It applies a Gaussian filter from scipy.ndimage to the 3D brain volume data using a sigma value of 4 to reduce noise in the image.

The code prepares to plot slices of the smoothed using gaussian_filter of sigma value 4 of brain volume data by defining variables for the subplot grid, number of subplots, 
number of slices, step size, and range of slices to plot. It creates a figure with subplots and iterates over the slices, plotting each one as a grayscale image.

Set the fig_rows and fig_cols to 4, then calculate the n_subplots by multiplying fig_rows and fig_cols, calculates step_size dividing n_slice by n_subplots,
then calculates plot_range by multiplying n_subplots and step_size, then it calculates start_stop from the difference of n_slice and plot_range and divides by 2
The program creates a figure with multiple subplots by using a loop by enumerating from the range of start_stop to plot_range by increasing by step_size,
set imshow by slicing data from the x axis,  

Finally, the code adjusts the layout so that the plots fit nicely in the figure using `plt.tight_layout`. The plot is not displayed immediately.

From a programmatic perspective, this code reads brain MRI data from an HDF5 file, reshapes the data into a 3D array, 
applies a Gaussian filter to smooth the image, and plots slices of the smoothed data.
