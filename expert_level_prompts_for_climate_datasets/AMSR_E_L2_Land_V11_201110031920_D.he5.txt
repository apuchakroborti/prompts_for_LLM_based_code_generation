A Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map visualization. 
At first, the program should import some libraries such as os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap

Here's what it does:
Reading the HDF5 file
The script opens the file `AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5` in read-only mode 
and extracts main data from the path `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields` in the data file
latitude data from the path /HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields/Latitude
longitude data from the path /HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields/Longitude

Data cleaning and masking
there is no _FillValue attribute in the dataset so need to assign a static value of -9999 to this
then assign numpy NaN value to main data comparing with _FillValue
and masked main data with numpy ma masked_array function with parameters main data, isnan of main data

Creating a Map
Using an equidistant cylindrical projection map 
with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -170 to 190 respectively

It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45 and labels with values of [1, 0, 0, 0], 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 181, 45 and labels with values of [0, 0, 0, 1]

The program should set scatter function with parameters of longitude, latitude, c=data, s=0.1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, and linewidth=0

Adding Colorbar and Title
A colorbar is added to the map, 
labeled with main dataset's units, and a title is set including the file basename and long_name
