A Python code that accesses and visualizes a NASA HDF-EOS data product. 
The program reads an HDF5 file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5` containing ozone data.

Here's what the code does:
At first, it should import some libraries such as os, cartopy.crs, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, h5py, LATITUDE_FORMATTER, LONGITUDE_FORMATTER from cartopy.mpl.gridliner 

1. It opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode and reads datasets `/Ozone`, `/Latitude`, and `/Longitude`. 
The ozone data is stored in a NumPy array `data`, 
while latitude and longitude are stored in `lat` and `lon` arrays, respectively.
2. The code also reads attributes like `units` set to `'DU'` and `long name` set to `'Ozone'`.
3. static _FillValue is -999.0 using this value, It replaces `_FillValue` from Ozone with `NaN` values and masks them using NumPy's `masked_where` function with parameters numpy isnan Ozone and Ozone data itself.
4. The code calculates the middle latitude and longitude values from the `lat` and `lon` arrays.
5. It creates an orthographic projection centered at the middle location using Cartopy's `Orthographic` class.
6. The scatter is set to the plot with parameters such as longitude, latitude, c=Ozone data, s=1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, transform=ccrs.PlateCarree
7. The ozone data is plotted on a map using Matplotlib, with points colored based on ozone data values.
8. Gridlines, coastlines, and degree labels are added to the plot.
9. A colorbar is created with a specific width value of 0.022 and padding of 0.01
