A python program
First, It should open the file "CAL_LID_L2_BlowingSnow_Antarctica-Standard-V2-00.2023-06.hdf5" in read-only mode.

The program should import h5py, os, cartopy.crs as ccrs, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, numpy as np, and LATITUDE_FORMATTER, LONGITUDE_FORMATTER from cartopy.mpl.gridliner


Next, It should read three datasets: 
    `/Snow_Fields/Blowing_Snow_Depol_Profile` containing blowing snow depolarization profile data, 
    and `/Geolocation_Fields/Latitude` and `/Geolocation_Fields/Longitude` containing geolocation data 

I then read the "units" attribute from the `/Snow_Fields/Blowing_Snow_Depol_Profile` dataset then decode the attribute and set a long_name for it as "Blowing_Snow_Depol_Profile". 
After reading the blowing snow depol profile data it convert the type of numpy to float64

The program reads part of the program data such as first column of the data from then slices data such as all data from the x-axis and 0th index data from y-index of 2D data

After that, The program should replace Blowing_Snow_Depol_Profile data that matches FillValue (0.0) and mask these values using numpy ma masked_where function with parameters numpy isnan Blowing_Snow_Depol_Profile data and Blowing_Snow_Depol_Profile data.

Using Cartopy, I create an orthographic projection map with parameters central_longitude=0, central_latitude=-90, globe=None
It also set plot axes projection=orth

The program should set scatter function with parameters of longitude, latitude, c=data, s=0.1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, and transform=ccrs.PlateCarree() 

I also add gridlines, coastlines, 
and set the colorbar with values 0.022 and padding with th evalue of 0.01

At the end, the plot title is set by combining with data file basename and long_name
