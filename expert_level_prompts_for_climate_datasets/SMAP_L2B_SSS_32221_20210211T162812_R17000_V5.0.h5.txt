A Python code that imports libraries such as os, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap, numpy as np, and h5py 
 reads an HDF5 file, extracts specific datasets, visualizes the data on a map, and saves the plot to a PNG file. 

The code starts by defining constants, including the HDF5 file name `SMAP_L2B_SSS_32221_20210211T162812_R17000_V5.0.h5`. 
It then reads the HDF5 file in read-only mode and extracts three datasets: 
`/lat` for latitude values, `/lon` for longitude values, and `/smap_spd` for data values, 
then it access attributes from the units, long_name, and _FillValue.

The code replaces the fill value with `NaN` and masks NaN values.

It then creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using Basemap with low resolution, drawing coastlines draws coastlines with linewidth of 0.5 
and parallels with values of numpy arrange -180, 91, 45, 
meridians with values of numpy of -180, 180, 45, 
and scatters the data points on the map colored by their values. 
A colorbar is added to the map with a label indicating the units of the data.
