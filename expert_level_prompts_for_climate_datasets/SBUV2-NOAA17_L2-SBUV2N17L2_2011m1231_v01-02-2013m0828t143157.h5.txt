Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing necessary libraries.
At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, FormatStrFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

Defining Constants
It defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read which is located at SBUV2-NOAA17_L2-SBUV2N17L2_2011m1231_v01-02-2013m0828t143157.h5

Reading Data
The script opens the HDF5 file and reads various datasets:
- `/SCIENCE_DATA/ProfileO3Retrieved`: 2D ozone profile data
- `/GEOLOCATION_DATA/Latitude`: 1D latitude values
- `/ANCILLARY_DATA/PressureLevels`: 1D pressure level values
- `nTimes`: 1D time values in seconds since 1993-01-01

It then access attributes such as units, valid_min, valid_max, _FillValue, and long_name
After that it uses decode function for the units and long_name

Data Processing
The script processes the ozone profile data by replacing invalid values with NaN, and creating a masked array.

Sorting Latitude Values
It sorts latitude values in ascending order.

Converting Time Values
Time values are converted from seconds to datetime objects.

Plotting the Data
A contour plot is created using latitude on the x-axis and pressure levels on the y-axis. The colorbar is labeled with ozone profile data units.

Customizing the Plot
The script customizes the plot by setting axis labels, adding a title, and annotating start and end times. It also inverts the y-axis, applies a log scale, 
and removes scientific notation from tick labels.
