At first, the program should import some libraries such as os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap

The script starts by defining a constant `FILE_NAME` set to the name of the HDF5 file. 
Then it opens the file in read-only mode.

It reads various datasets from the file, including:
`/RetrievalResults/xco2`: xco2 data
`/SoundingGeometry/sounding_latitude_geoid` : latitude data , 
`/SoundingGeometry/sounding_longitude_geoid` : longitude data, 
`/SoundingGeometry/sounding_altitude` as latitude data, 
`/RetrievalHeader/sounding_time_tai93`: time data

The script reads attribute named Units from both the xco2 and altitude data of 0th index.

Next, it creates two subplots: 
an orthographic projection map with low resolution, lat_0 value is -55 and lon_0 value is 120
showing the trajectory of the sounding using latitude and longitude coordinates, 
and a line plot showing the relationship between time and xco2 data, 
with a twin plot of time vs. altitude data.

It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -80, -0, 20, 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 181, 20

The script customizes the plots by setting axis labels, titles, and tick formats
