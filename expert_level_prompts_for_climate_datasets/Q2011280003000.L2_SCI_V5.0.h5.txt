A Python code that visualizes data from an HDF5 file. 
Here's what it does:
At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

Importing Libraries
The code starts by importing necessary libraries for operating system functions, working with HDF5 files, creating visualizations, and numerical computations.

Defining Constants
It defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `'Q2011280003000.L2_SCI_V5.0.h5'`, which is the name of an HDF5 file.

Opening the HDF5 File
The code opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode. The file object is assigned to the variable `f`.

Accessing Datasets and Attributes

Within the `with` block, it accesses several datasets and attributes from the HDF5 file:
`/Aquarius Data/SSS`: a dataset containing data, creates a variable datavar;
    then from datavar as it is a 2D data it access 1D data by slicing data of all rows and only taking 0th column 
 it also access attributes from the SSS dataset such as units, long_name, and _FillValue, then it decodes units and long_name data using decode function 
 

 Then for the latitude and longitude data it access the below data
 `/Navigation/sclat`: a 1D array extracted from the HDF5 file
 `/Navigation/sclon`: a 1D array extracted from the HDF5 file


Handling Fill Values and Creating a Map
The code replaces fill values with `NaN` (Not a Number) values, 
creates a masked array for efficient handling of missing or invalid data, 
and then creates a map using cylindrical projection with specified settings such as latitude range from -90 to 90 and longoitude range from -180 to 180.

Scatter Plot and Colorbar
It creates a scatter plot on the map using longitude and latitude as x and y coordinates, respectively, and sets the colormap to `jet`. 
A colorbar is also created with its label set to the units of the data.
