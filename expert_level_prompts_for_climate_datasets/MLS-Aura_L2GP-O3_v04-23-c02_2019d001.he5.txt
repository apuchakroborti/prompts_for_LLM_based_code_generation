Python script. 
Here's what it does:
At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, FormatStrFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

The script starts by opening an HE5 file named "MLS-Aura_L2GP-O3_v04-23-c02_2019d001.he5" in read mode.

It then accesses several datasets within the file using their sub paths:

"/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Data Fields/L2gpValue" (Ozone data)
"/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Latitude" (latitude values)
"/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Pressure" (pressure levels)
"/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Time" (time information)

It reads Ozone data of 0 to 70th index from the x-axis and all data from the y-axis of 2D data 
It also reads latitude from 0 to 70th index from the 1D data 
and pressure data from till 55th index of 1D data

Then from the Ozone, latitude, and longitude data it reads Units and Title and decoded the value

The program then reads the _FillValue and my comparing _FillValue and Ozone data it replaces the _FillValue data with numpy nan

Next, it stores two values using datetime function since 1993-01-01 + value of datetime. timedelta with parameter seconds= time from 0th index
and   datetime function since 1993-01-01 + value of datetime. timedelta with parameter seconds= time from 70th indexto in a string format.

Then it set the pcolormesh wih paramets latitude, longitude, and data.T

Then it adds xlabel and ylabel to the plt with lat_title and lat_units for the xlabel
then lon_title and lon_units

The plt sets set title for concatenating three values such as data Title, and the string constructed from the datatime and timedelta functions

After that it sets gca to plt as invert_yaxis and set_yscale with value of 'log', also set_major_formatter with %.1f
