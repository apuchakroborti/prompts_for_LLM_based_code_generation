A Python script. 
It reads an HDF-EOS5 file which is located at HIRDLS-Aura_L3ZFCNO2_v07-00-20-c01_2005d022-2008d077.he5, 
extracts specific datasets, manipulates the data, and creates a contour plot.
At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, FormatStrFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

Read datasets
The script starts by opening the HDF-EOS5 file and reading various datasets: 
    `/HDFEOS/ZAS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/NO2Ascending` (a 4D dataset containing NO2 data), 
    `/HDFEOS/ZAS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/Latitude` (a 1D dataset containing latitude values), 
    `/HDFEOS/ZAS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/Pressure` (a 1D dataset containing pressure values), 
    `/HDFEOS/ZAS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/Time` (a scalar dataset containing the time of measurement), from the sub group path of /ZAS/HIRDLS/Data Fields 
    and `HDFEOS/ZAS/HIRDLS/nCoeffs` (a scalar dataset containing the number of coefficients). from the sub group path /ZAS/HIRDLS
    The above all datasets from the root group HDFEOS

It reads NO2Ascending data of 0th index from the first and fourth dimensions and all of the data from the 2nd and 3rd dimensions of 4D data
Iand 0th index of the Time and nCoeffs data 

Read Attributes
The script then reads attributes such as Units, Title from NO2Ascending, Latitude, and Pressure datasets.
After that it reads the _FillValue attribute from the NO2Ascending dataset.

Then by comparing the NO2Ascending data with _FillValue it replaces NO2Ascending data with numpy nan value
It also maksed the NO2Ascending data using numpy ma masked_array function with parameters NO2Ascending data and condition with numpy isnan of NO2Ascending data

In the next step, it starts ploting data such as contourf plot with parameters latitude, Pressure, and NO2Ascending data
The a colorbar is added with label using set_label function with NO2Ascending's Units attributes value
It creates plot with parameters of NO2Ascending and pressure data

The plot's x label is set by combining both NO2Ascending Title and Units data 
The plot's y label is set by combining both Pressure's Title and Units data

It performs some data manipulation, including converting the date stored in `Time`, replacing fill values with NaN values, 
and creating a masked array for the `NO2Ascending` dataset.

The plot's title is the combined string of file basename, NO2Ascending's Title, and 0th index value of nCoeffs data

At the end, the gca of the plot is set such as invert yaxis, yscale value of log, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter with the value of '%.1f'
