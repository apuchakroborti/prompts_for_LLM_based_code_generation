The code starts by importing necessary libraries for working with operating system functions, creating plots and visualizations, numerical computations, 
map projections, and HDF5 files.
To be more specific the libraries are os, cartopy.crs, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, datetime


Defining Constants
A constant `FILE_NAME` is defined which is located at ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5 
which is the name of the HDF5 file to be processed.

Opening the HDF5 File and Accessing Datasets
The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode and accesses three datasets: 
`/gpsr/navigation/latitude` latitude data, 
`/gpsr/navigation/longitude` longitude data, 
`/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s` main data
and /atlas/pce1/background/delta_time time data 

Reads attributes named units and long_name with decoding using decode() function with parameters ascii and replace, 

The program should make a split window plot.  First plot is time vs. counts.
plt figure size is 10 by 10
ax1 subplot with value 2, 1, 1
elapsed_time is the result of subtractting 0th index value of time from time iteself

ax1 plot is set with parameters of elapsed_time, main datam and string of "bo"

ax1 xlabel is set to time_units
ax1 y label is set to string value of main data units
ax1 title is set by the comining result of data file basename, main datasetname and main dataset's long_name

it should find the mid point location of latitude and longitude such as lat_m and lon_m

It uses cartopy's ortho projection with parameters central_longitude=lon_m, central_latitude=lat_m, globe=None

The 2nd plot is the trajectory.
ax3 ploting with subplot function is set with parameters 2, 1, 2 and projection= orth

ax3 gridlines is set with parameters such as draw_labels=True and dms=True

ax3 global and coastlines should be set

ax3 plot with parameters longitude, latitude, color="blue", linewidth="2", transform=ccrs.Geodetic(),

Annotate the starting point.  Offset the annotation text by 200 km:
could be done via ax3 plot setting with values 0th index of longitude, 0th index of latitude, marker="o", color="red", transform=ccrs.Geodetic(),

ax3 text value is 0th index of longitude + 1.0, 0th index of latitude, "START", color="red", transform=ccrs.Geodetic()

ax3 title is Trajectory of Flight Path

figure layout is tight and with padding 3.0
