Python code that reads and visualizes ozone data from an HDF5 file. 

At first it imports some libraries such as datetime, os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, numpy

Then it reads datasets and attributes
/Data_Fields/ProfileOzone which is profileozone data
/Data_Fields/Latitude which latitude
/Data_Fields/ProfilePressureLevels which is ProfilePressureLevels
/Data_Fields/Date which contains date

It reads ProfileOzone 3D data as a slice of 0th index of x-axis and all from both y and z axis data from the 3 dimensiontal array
It also access 0th index of the Date data

It read units and long_name attribute with decoding from the profileozone, latitude, and longitude datasets

It access the _FillValue data from the profile ozone data and by comparing with _FillValue it set NaN value
and masked the profileozone data using numpy masked_where function with parameters of numpy isnan of data and data itself

Then the program should convert the ProfilePressureLevels data using numpy log10 function
then the contourf is set with parameters latitude, updated ProfilePressureLevels, and ProfileOzone's T data
After that it add a colorbar with label with the value of ProfileOzone data's units

plot xlabel is latitude_longname and latitude_units
plot y label is the combined string of ProfilePressureLevels's long_name and ProfilePressureLevels's units

The plot's title is the combined string of data file basename and ProfileOzone data's long_name
