A Python script that reads an HDF5 file, extracts specific datasets, processes the data, and saves it to a CSV file. Here's how it works:

The script starts by opening the HDF5 file 'OMSNO2_0.1x0.1_200501_SPv3.h5' in read mode.

It then reads three datasets from the file: '/OMI_SurfNO2', '/Longitude', and '/Latitude'. These are stored in variables named `dset`, `x`, and `y`.

Based on the Longitude and Latitude data, a meshgrid is created such as from two 1D arrays of Longitude and Latitude data it returns two 2D arrays named lon and lat

Then based on the 2D data of lon and lat create a map of cylindrical projection map with coastlines and countries
