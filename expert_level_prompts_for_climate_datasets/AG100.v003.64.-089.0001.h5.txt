A Python script that reads an HDF5 file containing ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map.
At first, the program should import some libraries such as os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap

1. Reads the input file using HDF5.
2. Extracts datasets: 
    `Mean Emissivity for Band 10` from the path '/Emissivity/Mean' (2D array with shape `(1, :, :)`) access description attribute and get the 0th index value
        here no units name and no long name so set these values as None and Mean emissivity for Band 10
    `latitude` data from the path /Geolocation/Latitude  
    and `longitude` from the path /Geolocation/Longitude (1D arrays)

    It also reads Description attributes data from the Mean dataset
3. Mean data's _FillValue is set to numpy NaN
and masked the data using numpy masked_where function with parameters of numpy isnan of Mean data and data itself
4. Creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using Basemap with high resolution specifying latitude values of 62.5 to 64.5 and longtitude values from 89.5 to 87.5.
5. It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
6. parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values 62, 65, 1 and labels of [1, 0, 0, 0]
7. and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -89, -87.5, 1 and labels of [0, 0, 0, 1]
8. Then it adds pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True
9. Adds a colorbar with units of 'None' and title combining value of data file base name long_name with value 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' to the plot.
