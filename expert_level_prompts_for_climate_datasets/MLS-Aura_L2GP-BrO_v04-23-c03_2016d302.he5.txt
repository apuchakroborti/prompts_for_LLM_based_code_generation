A Python code that reads an HDF-EOS5 file and plots BrO data against pressure. Here's what it does:

First, it imports necessary libraries such as os, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap, numpy as np, datetime, matplotlib.ticker import FormatStrFormatter and ScalarFormatter

Then it reads datasets such as,
Br0 data from the path within the file is (`/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields/BrO`).
Pressure values from the path `/Geolocation Fields/Pressure`
Time values from the path `/Geolocation Fields/Time` in the file

The program reads Br0 data of 399th index from the x axis and all data from the y axis
After that the program reads attributes such as MissingValue, _FillValue, Title, and Units from the Br0 dataset

Plotting
using plot function it pass two parameters one is Br0 data from 12 to 16th index from the converted 1D array and
pressure value from 12th to 16th index of 1D data

Then it sets the ylabel with value of Pressure Units
and ylabel with the value of Br0 Title and Br0 units
Also the plot title is set with the value of Br0 data Title and file basename

At the end, the gca is set with invert_yaxis, yscale value of log, minor formatter is ScalarFormatter, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter
