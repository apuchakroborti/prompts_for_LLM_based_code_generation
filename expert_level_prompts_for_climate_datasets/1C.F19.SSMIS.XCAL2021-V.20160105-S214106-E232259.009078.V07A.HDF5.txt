The code starts by loading an HDF5 file named "1C.F19.SSMIS.XCAL2021-V.20160105-S214106-E232259.009078.V07A.HDF5" in read-only mode.

At first, the program should import some libraries such as os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap

It then accesses the "/S1/Tc" dataset within the HDF5 file, it is a 3 dimensional data so take all data from 1st and 2nd dimensions and 0th index of 3rd dimension, 
extracting data values, units, LongName, and _FillValue. 
The code replaces _FillValue with NaN by comparing the main data from the dataset named Tc by comparing with the _FillValue data, 

It should then process the Tc data by checking where numpy data is nan and previously accessed Tc data. 
and extracts geolocation data below
latitude data from the path /S1/Latitude
and longitude data from the path /S1/Longitude

Next, it creates a cylindrical projection map with specific settings (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range etc.). 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 91, and 45.
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [True, False, False, True] 

The code then plots the dataset values as a scatter plot on the map, using the `jet` colormap for color and setting point size to 1.
the colorbar location is bottom and the padding is 10 percent with the label units which is accessed previously from the main dataset Tc

At the end, it creates a plot title using the file basename and Tc dataset's LongName
