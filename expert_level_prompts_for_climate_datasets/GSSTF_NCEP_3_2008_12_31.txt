It reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file which is located at GSSTFYC_3_Year_1988_2008.he5. 
At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

For reading data, it reads `SST` dataset from the path /HDFEOS/GRIDS/NCEP/Data Fields/SST
It then reads attributes from the SST dataset such as units and long_name and decodes them using decode() function 

It also accesses the _FillValue of 0th index only from the SST dataset
After that it read the 0th index data from the _FillValue attribute of SST data

Then the _FillValue data is applied to SST data for replacing _FillValue data by numpy nan value
After that it masked the SST data using the numpy masked_array function with the parameters data itself and the result of numpy isnan of data

Geo location data 
Since there are no latitude and longitude data in the data file, 
it should construct the longitude and latitude data based on the shape of the SST dataset
such as it first declares scaleX and scaleY variables then it sets the
scaleX = 360.0/ SST data shape from first index
scaleY = 180.0/ SST data shape from 0th index
In the next step it formed the latitude and longitude data such as 
longitude = numpy arange of SSTdata shape from first index * scaleX - 180 + scaleX/2
latitude = numpy arange of SSTdata shape from 0th index  * scaleY - 90 + scaleY/2

Visualizing the Data
The script creates a map with equidistant cylindrical projection, sets up its boundaries (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range ), 
It also adds parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 120, and 30 with the labels of [1, 0, 0, 0].
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [0, 0, 0, 1] 

While rendering the image it gets the x and y data from the result of basemap with parameters of longitude and latitude data
Then of Basemap's pcolormesh is set with values x, y, and SST data

At the end it set the colorbar to the basemap with label SST Units value using set_label function, and the plots title is set with value of file basename and SST data LongName value
