Python code that reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file which is located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5. 

Here's what it does:
At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, FormatStrFormatter and ScalarFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

Reading the File
Accessing Datasets
It reads three datasets: 
 `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/O3` containing ozone (O3) data it read 0th index from the x-axis and all data from the y-axis of 2D data
 `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Pressure` containing Pressure data
 `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Time` containing Time data, from Time data program reads only 0th index of linear data

Reading Attributes
The code reads several attributes such as Units from both the O3 and Pressure datasets, 
it then reads Title data from the O3, Time, and Pressure datasets 
it then uses these values by decoding using the decode() function 

After that it accesses _FillValue data from the O3 data sets
Then by comparing the O3 data and _FillValue it relaces the O3 data by numpy nan value

In the next step, it creats a variable named datestr and store the value such as datatime with parametes of 1993, 1, 1 combining with timedelta function with value of seconds=time 

Plotting
The code creates a plot of ozone (O3) data against pressure, customizing it with scientific notation for x-axis tick labels, log scale for the y-axis, 
inverted y-axis, and customized axis labels and title.

The plot's x label is set by combining both O3 Title and Units data 
The plot's y label is set by combining both Pressure data Title and Units data


The plot's title is the combined string of file basename, O3's Title and Units data

At the end, the gca of the plot is set such as invert yaxis, yscale value of log, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter with the value of '%g'
