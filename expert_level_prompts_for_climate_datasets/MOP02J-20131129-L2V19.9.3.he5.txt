File Input and Constants
We start by specifying the input file, `MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5`, which is stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.

At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

Extracting Data
we extract data from the path `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature` dataset.
We read its contents into an array called `data`, taking only the first column. 
We also retrieve the units and _FillValue attributes associated with this dataset.

It then decodes the value of units using decode() function

It then replace the _FillValue data from the RetrievedSurfaceTemperature data by numpy nan value

Extracting Geolocation Data
We extract geolocation data from the `/Latitude` and `/Longitude` datasets from the 
two too datasets from the paths /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude and /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude, 
which contain latitude and longitude values respectively.

Creating a Map
It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45, 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 180, 45 and labels with the list [True, False, False, True]

The program should set scatter function with paramets of longitude, latitude, c=data, s=1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, and linewidth=0

Customizing the Map
We add a colorbar to the map, representing the units of the data, and set label by using set_label function with the value units
