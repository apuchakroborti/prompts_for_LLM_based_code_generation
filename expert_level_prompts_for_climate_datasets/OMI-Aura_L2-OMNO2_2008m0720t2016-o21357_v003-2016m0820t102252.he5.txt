It reads an HDF5 file which is located at OMI-Aura_L2-OMNO2_2008m0720t2016-o21357_v003-2016m0820t102252.he5, 
extracts a dataset and its attributes, processes the data, and visualizes it on a map. 

At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

The file path and dataset name are defined as constants: `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/ColumnAmountNO2/Data Fields/CloudFraction` as data 
The code then reads all data and appl astype with parameters of numpy float64

It retrieves several attributes from the dataset, 
including 'ScaleFactor', 'Offset', 'MissingValue', '_FillValue', 'Title' with decode(), 'Units' with decode() 

The geolocation data is also read from the file: 
latitude and longitude arrays from the paths respectively 
/HDFEOS/SWATHS/ColumnAmountNO2/Geolocation Fields/Latitude
/HDFEOS/SWATHS/ColumnAmountNO2/Geolocation Fields/Longitude

The code replaces MissingValue and _FillValue by numpy nan 
then applies scaling and offset to the data such as data = ScaleFactor * (data - Offset), 
and masked the data using numpy masked_where function with parameters of numpy isnan of data and data itself

Using an equidistant cylindrical projection map 
with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively

It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 120, 30 and labels is list [1, 0, 0, 0], 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 180, 45 and labels with the list [0, 0, 0, 1]

The program should set scatter function with parameters of longitude, latitude, c=data, s=0.1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, and linewidth=0

At the end, I added a colorbar with using set_label function with the values of Units
