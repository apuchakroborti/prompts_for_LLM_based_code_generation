A Python script that reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file. 
Here's what it does:
At first, it should import libraries such as import os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

Reading File
The script opens the file 'TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5' in read mode.

Retrieving Data
It retrieves grid metadata from '/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0' and data from '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/Data Fields/SurfacePressure'. 
The data is converted to a NumPy array with dtype float64, and associated metadata like '_FillValue', 'MissingValue', 'Title' with decode(), 'Units' with decode() are retrieved, 


Data Processing
Invalid values (fill or missing) are set to NaN, and a masked array is created using numpy.ma.

Retrieving Longitude and Latitude
The script retrieves longitude and latitude datasets from '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/Data Fields/Longitude' and '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/Data Fields/Latitude', 
respectively, as NumPy arrays with dtype float64.

Creating a Map
A Basemap object is created with a cylindrical projection, resolution 'l' along with a latitude range of -90 to 90 and longitude range of -180 to 180, 
and defined map boundaries. Coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, parallels with parameers value of numpy arrange -45, 91, 45 and labels 1, 0, 0, 0, and meridians with numpy arrange of -180, 180, 45 and labels 0, 0, 0, 1 are drawn on the map.

Visualizing Data
The script visualizes the data on the map using pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data and latlon status. A colorbar with units label is added to the plot.
