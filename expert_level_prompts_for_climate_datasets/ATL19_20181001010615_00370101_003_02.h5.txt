The code starts by importing necessary libraries for working with operating system functions, creating plots and visualizations, numerical computations, 
map projections, and HDF5 files.
To be more specific the libraries are os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap

Defining Constants
A constant `FILE_NAME` is defined which is located at ATL19_20181001010615_00370101_003_02.h5, 
which is the name of the HDF5 file to be processed.

Opening the HDF5 File and Accessing Datasets
The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode and accesses three datasets: 
`/mid_latitude/latitude` latitude data, 
`mid_latitude/longitude` longitude data, 
and `/mid_latitude/beam_1/dot_avg` main data 

Reads attributes named units and long_name both with decoding using decode() function with parameters ascii and replace, 
and _FillValue from the main data
The main data type is set to astype float

main data's _FillValue is set to numpy NaN
and masked the data using numpy masked_where function with parameters of numpy isnan of data and data itself


Creating a Map
Using a cylindrical projection map 
with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively

It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 120, 30, 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 180, 45

Before setting pcolormesh the 180 should be subtractted from longitude value and update the longitude existing value 
Then it adds pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True

Adding Colorbar and Title
A colorbar is added to the map with location of bottom, 
labeled with main dataset's units, and a title is set including the file basename, and long_name
