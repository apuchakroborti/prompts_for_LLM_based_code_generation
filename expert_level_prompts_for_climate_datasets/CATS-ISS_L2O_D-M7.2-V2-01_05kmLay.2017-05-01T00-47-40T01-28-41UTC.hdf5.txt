It starts by loading an HDF5 file named 'CATS-ISS_L2O_D-M7.2-V2-01_05kmLay.2017-05-01T00-47-40T01-28-41UTC.hdf5'. 
At first it imports some libraries such as datetime, os, matplotlib and colors, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, numpy

The file is opened in read-only mode.
The code then accesses two datasets: 
'/layer_descriptor/Aerosol_Type_Fore_FOV' (a 2D array with aerosol type information) 
and '/geolocation/CATS_Fore_FOV_Latitude' 
and '/geolocation/CATS_Fore_FOV_Longitude' (2D arrays with latitude and longitude values).

from the Aerosol_Type_Fore_FOV data program reads extracts the first column from the 2D array
from the latitude data it should read the 2nd column of of the 2D array
from the longitude data it should read 2nd colmn of the 2D array

Next, it creates a discrete color map named cmap with 9 colors of "grey", "blue", "aqua", "yellow", "orange", "green", "red", "black", and "brown" each representing a specific aerosol type. 

A geographic map is created using a cylindrical projection with low resolution, latitude range of -90 to 90 and longitude range of -180 to 180, 
It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45 , 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 180, 45 and labels with the list [True, False, False, True]

The program should set scatter function with parameters of longitude, latitude, c=data, s=0.1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, and linewidth=0

The plot title is set with the value of data file basename

Then the program should define the bins and normalize for discrete colorbar
such as the bounds is set using numply linspace function with the values of 0, 9, 10
normalize is set by the value of matplotlib colors BoundaryNorm with values bounds and N value from the cmap

In the 2nd axes such as ax2 should be set using add_axes with list of values [0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.02]

then the matplotlib colorbar ColorBase values are set with values with parameters ax2, cmap, normalize, orientation="horizontal", spacing="proportional", ticks=bounds, boundaries=bounds, format="%1i"
At the end the ax xticklabels are set with parameter the list of [ "invalid", "marine", "p. marine", "dust", "dust mixture", "clean/bg", "p. continental", "smoke", "volcanic", ] and fontzie = 5
