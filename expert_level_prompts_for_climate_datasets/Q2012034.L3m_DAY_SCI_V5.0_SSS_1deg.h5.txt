The code starts by defining variables: `FILE_NAME` for an HDF5 file, and several others to store data from the file.
At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

It then reads the HDF5 file, storing the 'l3m_data' dataset in a variable named `datavar`. 
It retrieves data_minimum and data_maximum values, as well as a _FillValue, from the l3m_data's attributes.

The code processes the data by replacing fill values with NaNs and identifying invalid values outside a certain range. 

there are two other variables named units and long_name and set the values 'psu' and 'Sea Surface Salinity'

then it compares the data with value and sets with numpy NaN value 
after that it creates invalid data with logical or with parameters such as comparision of data less than data minimum and data greater than data maximum

Next, it creates a map visualization using `Basemap`, defining x and y coordinates, creating a meshgrid, and setting up a cylindrical projection.

It also sets the resolution as low and latitude values from -90 to 90 and longitude values -180 and 180 
It adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45, 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 180, 45 and labels list [True,False,False,True]

to the map, and plots the data as a scatter plot with colors represented by the 'jet' colormap.

At the end, it adds a colorbar with units, sets a title using the file name and long name of the data
