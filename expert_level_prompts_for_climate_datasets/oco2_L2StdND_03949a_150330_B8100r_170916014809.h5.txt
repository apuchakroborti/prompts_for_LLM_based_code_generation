Step-by-Step Explanation
The code reads an HDF5 file which is located at oco2_L2StdND_03949a_150330_B8100r_170916014809.h5 and creates a map with data visualization. Here's how it works:

At first, it should import libraries such as import os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

Defining Constants
A constant `FILE_NAME` is defined as the name of the HDF5 file to be read.

Opening the HDF5 File
The HDF5 file is opened in read-only mode, and the file object is assigned to `f`.

Reading Data
Data is read from `/RetrievalResults/xco2` as name then it stores the values to a variable named `data`. 
The Units and Description of the dataset are also retrieved.

Reading Geolocation Data
Geolocation data is read from `/RetrievalGeometry/retrieval_latitude` and `/RetrievalGeometry/retrieval_longitude` into NumPy arrays that stored the data into the variables `latitude` and `longitude` respectively

Using a cylindrical projection map 
with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively

It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45, 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 180, 45 and labels with the list [True, False, False, True]

The program should set scatter function with paramets of lon, lat, c=data, s=1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, and linewidth=0

At the end, I adds a colorbar with parameteres location="bottom", formation="%.1e" with 10% padding
I also adds label using set_label function with the values of Units
