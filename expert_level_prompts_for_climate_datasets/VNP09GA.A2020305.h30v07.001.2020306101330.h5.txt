a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map plot. 

Here's how it works:

Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing necessary libraries such as os, re, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 for file system operations, parsing metadata strings, 
working with HDF5 files, performing cartographic transformations, numerical computations, and creating visualizations.

Reading HDF5 File
'/HDFEOS/GRIDS/VNP_Grid_DNB/Data Fields/BrightnessTemperature_M12' which is called name and read all data and call the function astype(np.float)

the below attributes are accessed from this dataset
# Read attributes.
'scale_factor', 'add_offset', 'units', '_FillValue', 'long_name', the decode function is needed for the units and long_name

Another is gridmeta dataset the path in the file is '/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0'


The script opens the specified HDF5 file, accesses the desired grid and data field datasets, 
and reads the actual data values into a NumPy array and convert datatype to numpy float64.

Reading Attributes
Various attributes associated with the data field dataset are read, including scaling factor, offset, units of measurement, fill value, and descriptive name.
It then decoded the inits and long name by using decode function

Constructing Grid
Grid extent information is extracted from metadata using regular expressions. The script then creates linearly spaced arrays and meshgrid arrays from the grid extent coordinates.

from the gridmeta data it extracts data of upper_left_x and and upper_left_y using group match of regex ''UpperLeftPointMtrs=\((?P<upper_left_x>[+-]?\d+\.\d+),(?P<upper_left_y>[+-]?\d+\.\d+)\)''', re.VERBOSE
Then using line space it reads data that is used for constructing meshgrid data and that are used later for forming longitude and latitude data

Coordinate Transformations
A coordinate transformation from Sinusoidal to WGS84 (Latitude-Longitude) is performed using a projection library.

Data Processing
The script applies the fill value and scaling factor to the data values, replacing fill values with NaN and scaling the data.

Visualization
A zoomed-in map plot is created using a mapping toolkit. The plot includes transformed longitude and latitude coordinates, parallels and meridians, and a pseudocolor mesh plot of the data values with a colorbar.

While plotting it adds parallels with values of min of lat, max of lat and 1
for meridians it uses min of lon, max of lon and 2
