A python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file. 
Here's what it does:
At first, the program should import some libraries such as os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap

import h5py

Step 1: Load Data
The script loads an HDF5 file and extracts several datasets:
	'solarAzimuthAngle' (solar azimuth angle) from the path /S2/solarAzimuthAngle
	and for the geolocation data it reads 
	`latitude` from the path /S2/Latitude and 
	`longitude` from the path /S2/Longitude (which are geolocation data)

Then it accesses two attributes named units and _FillValue from the solarAzimuthAngle dataset

Step 2: Process Solar Azimuth Angle Data
It processes the solar azimuth angle data by replacing _FillValue with NaN and masking NaN values.

Step 3: Create Map and Plot Data
The script creates a map with projection named cylindrical map projection, 
sets up its boundaries (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range etc), 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 91, and 45.
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [True, False, False, True] 

Step 4: Add Colorbar and Title
Then it adds scatter values such as longitude, latitude data, cmap such as plt.cm.jet, no edge color and linewidth equal to 0,
the colorbar location is bottom and the padding is 10 percent with the value of units which is accessed previously from the dataset solarAzimuthAngle
