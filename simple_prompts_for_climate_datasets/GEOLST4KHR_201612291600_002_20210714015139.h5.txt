a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map visualization. 
Here's how it works:

Reading HDF5 File
The script opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode and assigns it to a variable.

Extracting Data and Attributes
It extracts various datasets and attributes from the HDF5 file, including `/lst`, which contains the data of interest.
Then it updates the data type to np.float64 
The script also extracts several attributes like scale factor, add offset, units of measurement, fill value, and long description of the dataset, 
the decodes the value of units and long name using decode function.

It then data compares with the fill value and set numpy NaN value, then scale the data by multiplying scale factor attriute then add the offset values to it 

Extracting Latitude and Longitude
The script extracts two additional datasets: `/lon` for longitude values and `/lat` for latitude values then it updates both of the lon and lat values by using numpy float64.

Data Processing
It applies transformations to the data, replacing fill values with NaN, applying scale factor and add offset, and creating a masked array where NaN values are excluded.

Creating Map Visualization
Using `Basemap`, the script creates a cylindrical projection map with low-resolution specifying values of latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude values of -180 to 180 coastlines. 
It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map, and creates a scatter plot of the data using the Jet colormap.

Adding Colorbar and Title
The script adds a colorbar to the map, sets its label to the units of measurement, and sets the title of the plot to include the base name and long description of the dataset.
