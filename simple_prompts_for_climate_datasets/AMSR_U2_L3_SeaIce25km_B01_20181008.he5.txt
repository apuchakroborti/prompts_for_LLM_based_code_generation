A Python code that processes data from an HDF-EOS5 file. 
Here's what it does:

The program should read the dataset  '/SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY' from the sub path /HDFEOS/GRIDS/NpPolarGrid 25km/Data Fields
The main function takes a file name as input and performs several steps. 
It identifies the data field using the defined constant, 
opens the HDF-EOS5 file and extracts metadata and projection parameters.

Then, it processes the data by replacing 0 values with NaN, multiplying by 0.1, and creating a masked array. 
It constructs a grid using the extracted projection parameters and data shape, and transforms the EASE Grid to WGS84 using pyproj.

At the end, it creates a map using Basemap, plots the data, adds a colorbar
The code also defines a main script that calls the main function with an example HDF-EOS5 file name as input.
