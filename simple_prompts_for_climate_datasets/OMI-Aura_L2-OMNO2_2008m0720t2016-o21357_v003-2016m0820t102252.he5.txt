It reads an HDF5 file which is located at OMI-Aura_L2-OMNO2_2008m0720t2016-o21357_v003-2016m0820t102252.he5, 
extracts a dataset and its attributes, processes the data, and visualizes it on a map. 

The file path and dataset name are defined as constants: `/HDFEOS/SWATHS /ColumnAmount NO2/Data Fields/CloudFraction`. 
The code then reads this dataset into a NumPy array.

It retrieves several attributes from the dataset, including scaling and offset values, title, units, and missing value detection. 

The geolocation data is also read from the file: latitude and longitude arrays from the sub group path /HDFEOS /SWATHS/ColumnAmountN O2/Geolocation Fields/

The code replaces missing and fill values with NaN, applies scaling and offset to the data, and creates a masked array to handle NaN values.

At the end, it uses Basemap to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively, 
plots the data as a scatter plot using the longitude and latitude arrays
