a Python script that reads an HDF-EOS5 swath file and creates a map with plotted data. Here's what it does:
Importing Libraries
The script imports necessary libraries for interacting with the operating system, reading/writing HDF5 files, creating plots/visualizations, and numerical computations.

Defining Constants
Two constants are defined: `FILE_NAME` (the name of the HDF-EOS5 swath file) and `units` (an empty string to be populated later).

Reading Data
The script opens the HDF file in read-only mode and reads data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/ /RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`. 
It extracts units then decoded using decode function and fill values, replaces fill values with NaN, and assigns the data to `data`.

Reading Geolocation Data
It reads geolocation data from `/Geolocation Fields/Latitude` and `/Geolocation Fields/Longitude` from the sub group of /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02 
assigning them to `latitude` and `longitude`.

Creating a Map
The script creates a cylindrical map with low resolution, sets latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude -180 to 180 limits, and draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians.

Plotting Data
It plots the `data` array on the map using a scatter plot, adds a colorbar with units as the label
