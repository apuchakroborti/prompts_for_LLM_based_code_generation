Python code that reads an HDF5 file, extracts data and metadata, creates a map, plots the data on it, and saves the figure as a PNG file. 
Here's what the code does:

Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
The code starts by importing several libraries for interacting with the operating system, creating plots and visualizations, numerical computations, creating maps, and reading HDF5 files.

Step 2: Defining constants
A constant `FILE_NAME` is defined as the name of the HDF5 file to be read, "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

Step 3: Opening the HDF5 file
The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode using a `with` statement to ensure proper closure.

Step 4: Reading datasets from the HDF5 file
Three datasets are read from the HDF5 file:
`latitude` from `/latitude`
`longitude` from `/longitude`
`data` from `/heights/swh`

from the sub group /gt1l/ssh segments

Each dataset is read entirely using slicing.

Step 5: Extracting metadata
Metadata is extracted from the `data` dataset:
`units`: units of measurement
`long name`: longer description of the data

Step 6: Creating a map

An equidistant cylindrical projection map is created with a low-resolution coastline database, latitude and longitude limits, and grid lines spaced at 30° 
and 45° intervals.

Step 7: Plotting the data
The `data` values are plotted on the map using a scatter plot, colored according to their value. A colorbar is created and labeled with the units of measurement.

Step 8: Adding title and saving the figure
A title is set for the plot using the file name, dataset name, and long description.
