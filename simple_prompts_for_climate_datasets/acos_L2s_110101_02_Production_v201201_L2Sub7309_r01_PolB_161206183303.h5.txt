It seems to visualize data from an HDF5 file containing GOSAT ACOS L2 Swath data.

The script starts by defining a constant `FILE_NAME` set to the name of the HDF5 file. Then it opens the file in read-only mode.

It reads various datasets from the file, including:
- `/RetrievalResults/xco2`: CO2 data
- `sounding_latitude_geoid`, `sounding_longitude_geoid`, and `sounding_altitude` as latitude, longitude, and altitude data respectively from SoundingGeometry root group
- `/RetrievalHeader/sounding_time_tai93`: time data

The script reads attribute named units from the CO2 and altitude data of 0th index.

Next, it creates two subplots: an orthographic projection map showing the trajectory of the sounding using latitude and longitude coordinates, 
and a line plot showing the relationship between time and CO2 data, with a twin plot of time vs. altitude data.

The script customizes the plots by setting axis labels, titles, and tick formats
