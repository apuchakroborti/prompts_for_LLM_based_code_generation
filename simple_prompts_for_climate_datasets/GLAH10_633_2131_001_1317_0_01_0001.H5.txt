A Python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file. 
Here's how it works:

Reading Data
The script reads data from the HDF5 file, depending on a setting. 
It extracts latitude values such as d_lat, longitude values such as d lon, surface temperature r Surface temp values, and UTC time values from the file.
The code then applies valid min and max values to the longitudes and latitudes datasets and take slices of 2D datasets from valid min to valid max 

Visualizing the Data
The script then creates a map visualization of the data using Basemap. 
It sets up an equidistant cylindrical projection with a low-resolution coastline database, draws coastlines, parallels, 
and meridians on the map, and scatters the longitude and latitude values on the map, colored by surface temperature. 
A colorbar is added with the units of the temperature values.

The script has a main program that sets the HDF5 file name and calls the `run` function with this file name. 
The `run` function takes care of accessing and visualizing the data in the file.
