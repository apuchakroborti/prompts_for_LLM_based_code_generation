Python script. Here's what it does:

The script starts by opening an HE5 file named "MLS-Aura_L2GP-O3_v04-23-c02_2019d001.he5" in read mode.

It then accesses several datasets within the file using their sub paths:

"/Data Fields/L2gpValue" (Ozone data)
"/Latitude" (latitude values)
"/Pressure" (pressure levels)
"/Time" (time information) these are located at the root group /Geolocation Fields

all have base path HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3


The script reads the data from each dataset it read Ozone data of 0 to 70th index from the x-axis and all data from the y-axis of 2D data 
It also reads latitude from 0 to 70th index from the 1D data and pressure data from, including units and titles. 
It also replaces fill values with NaNs and creates a masked array.

Next, it converts the time information from seconds since 1993-01-01 to a string format.

Finally, the script visualizes the Ozone data using a pseudocolor plot, adds a colorbar with units, and sets axis labels and title.
