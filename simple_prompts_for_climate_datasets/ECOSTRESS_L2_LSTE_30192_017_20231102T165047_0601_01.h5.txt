a Python code. Here's what it does:

Importing Libraries and Defining File Names

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining two file names: `FILE_NAME` for an ECOSTRESS L2 HDF5 file 
and `FILE_NAME_GEO` for an ECOSTRESS L1B GEO HDF5 file which is located at ECOSTRESS_L1B_GEO_30192_017_20231102T165047_0601_01.h5.py

Opening HDF5 Files and Accessing Data

It opens both files in read-only mode and accesses the following data:

 `/SDS/LST` dataset (Land Surface Temperature data) with attributes like scale, offset, units, fill value, and long name
 `/longitude` and `/latitude` datasets (from Geolocation) (longitude and latitude data)

Data Processing
It updates the data type to np.float64
The code processes the LST data by replacing fill values with NaN, 
The script also extracts several attributes like scale factor, add offset, units of measurement, fill value, and long description of the dataset, 
the decodes the value of units and long name using decode function.
It creats a masked array using numpy masked array and checking isnan or not 
It also updates longitude and latitude data type using astype of numpy float64

Map Visualization
Using a cylindrical projection of low resolution, the code creates a map visualization using latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude range from -180 to 180 
with coastlines, parallels, and meridians drawn. 
It then scatter plots the LST data using longitude and latitude values, with a colorbar.
