A Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map visualization. 

Here's what it does:
Step 1: Reading the HDF5 file
The script opens the file `AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5` in read-only mode 
and extracts data from `Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields` from the sub-group '/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data'.

Step 2: Extracting data
It retrieves the entire dataset, as well as arrays of latitude and longitude values. 
Additionally, it extracts an array of values for the specific field `SoilMoisture SCA`.

Step 3: Data cleaning and masking
there is no fill value attribute in the dataset so need to assign fill value -9999
then assign numpy NaN value comparing with fill value
NaN (Not a Number) and creates a masked array to handle missing data efficiently by checking isnan

Step 4: Creating the map
It uses a cylindrical map projection, sets low resolution and limits such as latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -170 to 180, 
and draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians. 
The script then scatters longitude and latitude values on the map, coloring each point according to its corresponding value.

Step 5: Adding a colorbar and title
The script adds a colorbar to the map and sets the title, including the file name and field name.
