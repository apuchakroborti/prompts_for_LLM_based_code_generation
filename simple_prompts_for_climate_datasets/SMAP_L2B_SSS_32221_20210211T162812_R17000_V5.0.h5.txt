a Python code that reads an HDF5 file, extracts specific datasets, visualizes the data on a map, and saves the plot to a PNG file. 

The code starts by defining constants, including the HDF5 file name `SMAP_L2B_SSS_32221_20210211T162812_R17000_V5.0.h5`. 
It then reads the HDF5 file in read-only mode and extracts three datasets: 
`/lat` for latitude values, `/lon` for longitude values, and `/smap_spd` for data values, 
then it access attributes from the units, long name, and fill value.

The code replaces the fill value with `NaN` and masks NaN values. 
It then creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using Basemap, drawing coastlines, parallels, and meridians, 
and scatters the data points on the map colored by their values. A colorbar is added to the map with a label indicating the units of the data.

The code sets the title of the plot using the HDF5 file base name and dataset long name,
