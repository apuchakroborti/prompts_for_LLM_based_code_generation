The code starts by loading an HDF5 file named "1C.F19.SSMIS.XCAL2021-V.20160105-S214106-E232259.009078.V07A.HDF5" in read-only mode.

It then accesses the "/S1/Tc" dataset within the HDF5 file, it is a 3 dimensional data so take all data from x and y axis and 0th slice from z axis, 
extracting data values, units, long name, and fill value. 
The code replaces fill values with NaN by comparing the main data from the dataset named Tc by comparing with the _Fill Value data, 
It should then process the Tc data by checking where numpy data is nan and previously accessed Tc data. 
and extracts geolocation data (latitude and longitude).

Next, it creates a cylindrical projection map with specific settings (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range etc.). 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 91, and 45.
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [True, False, False, True] 

The code then plots the dataset values as a scatter plot on the map, using the `jet` colormap for color and setting point size to 1.
the colorbar location is bottom and the padding is 10 percent with the label units which is accessed previously from the main dataset Tc
