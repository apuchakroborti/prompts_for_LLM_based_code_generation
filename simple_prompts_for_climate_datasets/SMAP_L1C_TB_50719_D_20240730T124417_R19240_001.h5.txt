I'm working with an HDF5 file containing SMAP L1C data. 
Here's what I've done so far:
First, I defined the file name as "SMAP_L1C_TB_50719_D_20240730T124417_R19240_001.h5". 
Then, I opened the file in read mode and accessed a dataset named "/Global Projection/cell_tb_h_fore", which contains the main data.

I also extracted attributes from this dataset, including units of measurement, long description, fill value, and valid range. 
I decoded these attribute values from ASCII to Unicode and identified invalid data points by checking if they're outside the valid range or equal to the fill value. 
These points were set to NaN (Not a Number).
It then decodes the long name by using decode function with ascii and replace parameters
It the calculates invalid data using numpy logical or method using comparison with data greater than valid max and less than valid min 
Then the resulted invalid calculates again with parameters invalid and comparison with data and fill value
Then it sets numpy NaN values to invalid data
After that it creates masked array of data using numpy masked array and checking numpy isnan

Next, I accessed geolocation datasets "/cell_lat" and "/cell_lon" from the group Global_Projection, which contain latitude and longitude values respectively.

Using this data, I created a map with a cylindrical projection, drew coastlines, parallels, and meridians, and scattered the data points on the map. 
I also added a colorbar of bottom location and 10 percent padding represent the data values.
