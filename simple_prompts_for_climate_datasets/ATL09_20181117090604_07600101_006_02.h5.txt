Here is the rewritten description:
I have a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map visualization. Here's what it does:
File Input
The script starts by opening an HDF5 file called `ATL09_20181117090604_07600101_006_02.h5` in read-only mode.

Data Extraction
Within the file, the script extracts three datasets:
the root group is /profile_1 and the datasets are `/high rate/latitude`, containing latitude values,
`/high rate/longitude`, containing longitude values, `/high rate/apparent surf reflec`, containing surface reflectance values

For each dataset, it retrieves the data values and attribute values like `valid min`, `valid max`, `units`, and `long name`.

Map Visualization
The script creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map with a latitude range of -90 to 90 and longitude range of -180 to 180. 
It then plots the surface reflectance values on the map using a scatter plot, with longitude and latitude as coordinates.

Additional Map Features
The script adds coastlines and gridlines to the map.

Colorbar and Title
It creates a colorbar for the scatter plot, labeling it with the units of the surface reflectance values. 
The title includes the file name and dataset long name.
