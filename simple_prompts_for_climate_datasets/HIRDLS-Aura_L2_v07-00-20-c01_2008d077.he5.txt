Python code that reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file which is located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5. 

Here's what it does:

Reading the File
The code opens the HDF-EOS5 file in read-only mode.

Accessing Datasets
It reads three datasets: 
 `/Data Fields/O3` containing ozone (O3) data it read 0th index from the x-axis and all data from the y-axis of 2D data
 `/Pressure` containing pressure data
 `/Time` from /Geolocation Fields containing time data, reads only 0th index of linear data
from the sub group path /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS

Reading Attributes
The code reads several attributes such as Units from both the O3 and pressure datasets, it then read title data from the O3, time, and pressure datasets 
it then uses these values by decoding using the decode() function 

After that it accesses fill values data
Then by comparing the O3 data and fill values it relaces the O3 data by numpy nan value

Converts date stored as a six-digit number to a string using `datetime` from the time dataset

Plotting
The code creates a plot of ozone (O3) data against pressure, customizing it with scientific notation for x-axis tick labels, log scale for the y-axis, 
inverted y-axis, and customized axis labels and title.

The plot's x label is set by combining both O3 title and units data 
The plot's y label is set by combining both pressure title and units data
