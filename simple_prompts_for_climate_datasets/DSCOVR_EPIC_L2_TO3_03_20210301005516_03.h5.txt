a Python code that accesses and visualizes a NASA HDF-EOS data product. 
The program reads an HDF5 file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5` containing ozone data.

Here's what the code does:

1. It opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode and reads datasets `/Ozone`, `/Latitude`, and `/Longitude`. 
The ozone data is stored in a NumPy array `data`, while latitude and longitude are stored in `lat` and `lon` arrays, respectively.
2. The code also reads attributes like `units` set to `'DU'` and `long name` set to `'Ozone'`.
3. It replaces `Fill value` with `NaN` values and masks them using NumPy's `masked_where` function.
4. The code calculates the middle latitude and longitude values from the `lat` and `lon` arrays.
5. It creates an orthographic projection centered at the middle location using Cartopy's `Orthographic` class.
6. The ozone data is plotted on a map using Matplotlib, with points colored based on ozone data values.
7. Gridlines, coastlines, and degree labels are added to the plot.
8. A colorbar is created with a specific width and padding.
