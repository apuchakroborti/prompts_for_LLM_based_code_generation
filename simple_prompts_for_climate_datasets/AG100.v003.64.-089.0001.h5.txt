a Python script that reads an HDF5 file containing ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map. 

The main function `run` takes an input file name and performs the following steps:

1. Reads the input file using HDF5.
2. Extracts datasets: 
    - `Mean Emissivity for Band 10` (2D array with shape `(1, :, :)`) access description attribute and get the 0th index value
        here no units name and no long name so set these values as None and Mean emissivity for Band 10
    - `latitude` and `longitude` (1D arrays)
3. Applies fill value (-9999) and scaling (0.001) to the extracted data.
4. Creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using Basemap with high resolution specifying latitude values of 62.5 to 64.5 and longtitude values from 89.5 to 87.5.
5. Plots the scaled data on the map using `pcolormesh`.
6. Adds a colorbar and title to the plot.

The script then sets the input file name to `AG100.v003.64.-089.0001.h5` 
At the end, it calls the `run` function with the input file name as an argument.
