Loading data from an HDF5 file
The code opens an HDF5 file in read-only mode and accesses three datasets: `/pt1/latitude`, `/pt1/longitude`, and `/pt1/h corr`. 
It reads the data into memory and handles missing values by replacing fill values with NaN (Not a Number) values.

Creating a map visualization
The code creates a map using Basemap, with an equidistant cylindrical projection and low-resolution with latitude and longitude boundaries (such as -90 to 90 and -180 to 180) respectively
coastline database. 
It subsets the data for Cycle 3 and plots it as a scatter plot on the map.

Adding details to the plot
The code adds a colorbar and title to the plot, including the file name, dataset name, and long name from the HDF5 file attributes.
