A Python script. It reads an HDF-EOS5 file which is located at HIRDLS-Aura_L3ZFCNO2_v07-00-20-c01_2005d022-2008d077.he5, 
extracts specific datasets, manipulates the data, and creates a contour plot.

Read datasets
The script starts by opening the HDF-EOS5 file and reading various datasets: 
    `NO2Ascending` (a 3D dataset containing NO2 data), 
    `Latitude` (a 1D dataset containing latitude values), 
    `Pressure` (a 1D dataset containing pressure values), 
    `Time` (a scalar dataset containing the time of measurement), from the sub group path of /ZAS/HIRDLS/Data Fields 
    and `nCoeffs` (a scalar dataset containing the number of coefficients). from the sub group path /ZAS/HIRDLS
    The above all datasets from the root group HDFEOS

It reads data using slicing such as 0th row from the first and fourth dimensions, and all of the data from the 2nd and 3rd dimensions of 4D data
It reads 0th index of the time and nCoeffs data 

Read Attributes
The script then reads attributes such as units, titles from NO2Ascending, Latitude, and Pressure datasets.
After that it read the fill values attributes from the NO2Ascending dataset.

Then by comparing the NO2Ascending data with fill values it relaces the data with numpy nan value

It creates plot with parameters of NO2Ascending and pressure data

The plot's x label is set by combining both NO2Ascending title and units data 
The plot's y label is set by combining both pressure title and units data

It performs some data manipulation, including converting the date stored in `Time`, replacing fill values with NaN values, 
and creating a masked array for the `NO2Ascending` dataset.

Finally, the script creates a contour plot of the `NO2Ascending` dataset using latitude on the x-axis and pressure on the y-axis, adds a colorbar, 
labels the axes
