A Python code. 
Here's what it does:

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining an HDF5 file named `'SMAP_L4_SM_gph_20200915T193000_Vv7032_001.h5'`.

It then opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using a context manager, ensuring the file is properly closed when the script finishes executing. 
Within the context manager, it accesses various datasets and attributes:

`sm_profile` dataset under `/Geophysical Data/`
Reads entire dataset into an array called `data`
Reads attributes like `units`, `long name`, `_Fill Value`, `valid max`, and `valid min`

It then decodes the long name by using decode function with ascii and replace parameters
It the calculates invalid data using numpy logical or uisng comparison with data greater than valid max and less than valid min 
Then the resulted invalid calculates again with parameters invalid and comparison with data and fill value

The code then processes the `data` array by decoding attribute values, identifying invalid values, and creating a masked array to exclude NaN values.

It also reads two additional datasets: `latitude` under `/cell_lat/` and `longitude` under `/cell_lon/`.

Using these data points, it creates a map visualization specifying latitude range of -90 to 90 and longditude range of -180 to 180 
with coastlines, parallels, and meridians drawn on the map. 
The plot is customized with a colorbar and title using the HDF5 file name and long name associated with the `sm_profile` dataset.
