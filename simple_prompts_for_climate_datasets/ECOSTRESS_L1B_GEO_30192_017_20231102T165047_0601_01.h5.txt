a Python script that reads data from two HDF5 files. Here's what it does:

First, it imports necessary libraries and defines file names and paths for the ECOSTRESS L2 and L1B GEO HDF5 files.

Then, it opens these files in read-only mode and reads various datasets and attributes:

From the L2 file: "Lst" dataset (land surface temperature data), scale factor, offset, units, fill value, and long name. which is located at:
    ECOSTRESS_L2_LSTE_30192_017_20231102T165047_0601_01.h5.py
From the L1B GEO file: longitude and latitude values.

Then from the SDS LST dataset, It updates the data type to np.float64
The code processes the LST data by replacing fill values with NaN, 
The script also extracts several attributes like scale factor, add offset, units of measurement, fill value, and long description of the dataset, 
the decodes the value of units and long name using decode function.
It creats a masked array using numpy masked array and checking isnan or not 
It also updates longitude and latitude data type using astype of numpy float64

The script then processes the data by replacing fill values with NaN, applying scale factors and offsets, and creating masked arrays.

Next, it creates a map projection using Basemap with Albers Equal-Area Conic (AEA) projection, low resolution, 
and specific bounding box parameters such as from minimum values to maximum values of latitude and longitude.

Finally, it plots the LST data on the map projection, adds coastlines, parallels, meridians, and a colorbar with units, 
and saves the plot to a PNG file named after the input HDF5 file.
