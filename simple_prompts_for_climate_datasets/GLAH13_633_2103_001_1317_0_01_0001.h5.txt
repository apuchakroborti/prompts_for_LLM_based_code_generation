A Python code that processes an HDF5 file. 
Here's what it does:
The code imports necessary libraries and defines a `run` function that takes an HDF5 file name as an argument.
To access the HDF5 file, depending on a variable setting. 
It extracts datasets from the file, including latitude named d_lat, longitude named d_lon, d Surface temp, 
and time values from groups like `Data1HZ --> Geolocation` and `Data1HZ --> Atmosphere`.

The code then applies valid min and max values to these datasets and take slices of 2D datasets from valid min to valid max 
and creates a plot with two subplots: one showing surface temperature vs. elapsed time, 
and another displaying a map of the satellite's trajectory using Basemap.

The program uses Matplotlib for plotting and handles valid min and max values for each dataset.
