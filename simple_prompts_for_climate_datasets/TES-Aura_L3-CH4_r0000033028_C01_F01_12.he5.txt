a Python script that reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file. Here's what it does:

Reading File
The script opens the file 'TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5' in read mode.

Retrieving Data
It retrieves grid metadata from '/HDFEOSINFORMATION/StructMetadata.0' and data from '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/DataFields/SurfacePressure'. 
The data is converted to a NumPy array with dtype float64, and associated metadata like fill value, missing value, title, and units are retrieved, 
after that attributes values title and units are decoded using decode function.

Data Processing
Invalid values (fill or missing) are set to NaN, and a masked array is created using numpy.ma.

Retrieving Longitude and Latitude
The script retrieves longitude and latitude datasets from '/Longitude' and '/Latitude' from the sub group /HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/Data Fields, 
respectively, as NumPy arrays with dtype float64.

Creating a Map
A Basemap object is created with a cylindrical projection, resolution 'l' along with a latitude range of -90 to 90 and longitude range of -180 to 180, 
and defined map boundaries. Coastlines, parallels, and meridians are drawn on the map.

Visualizing Data
The script visualizes the data on the map using pcolormesh, with longitude and latitude as x and y coordinates. A colorbar is added to the plot.
