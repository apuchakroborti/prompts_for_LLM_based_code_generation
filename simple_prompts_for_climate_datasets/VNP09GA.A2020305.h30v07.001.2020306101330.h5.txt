a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map plot. 

Here's how it works:

Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing necessary libraries for file system operations, parsing metadata strings, 
working with HDF5 files, performing cartographic transformations, numerical computations, and creating visualizations.

Defining Constants
Three constants are defined: `FILE_NAME` (the HDF5 file name), `GRID_NAME` (the grid dataset name within the HDF5 file), and `DATAFIELD_NAME` (the data field dataset name).
GRID_NAME is 'VNPGrid500m 2D' DATAFIELDNAME are 'SurfReflect_I3_1' and HDFEOS INFORMATION StructMetadata.0'

Reading HDF5 File
The script opens the specified HDF5 file, accesses the desired grid and data field datasets, 
and reads the actual data values into a NumPy array and convert datatype to numpy float64.

Reading Attributes
Various attributes associated with the data field dataset are read, including scaling factor, offset, units of measurement, fill value, and descriptive name.
It then decoded the inits and long name by using decode function

Constructing Grid
Grid extent information is extracted from metadata using regular expressions. The script then creates linearly spaced arrays and meshgrid arrays from the grid extent coordinates.

Coordinate Transformations
A coordinate transformation from Sinusoidal to WGS84 (Latitude-Longitude) is performed using a projection library.

Data Processing
The script applies the fill value and scaling factor to the data values, replacing fill values with NaN and scaling the data.

Visualization
A zoomed-in map plot is created using a mapping toolkit. The plot includes transformed longitude and latitude coordinates, parallels and meridians, and a pseudocolor mesh plot of the data values with a colorbar.
