a Python script that reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file, specifically a LAADS VNP46A1 Geographic projection Grid file. Here's what it does

The program should import:
os, re, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Reading the HDF5 file

The script opens the file in read-only mode and reads three datasets: 
 `/GRID/VNP_Grid_DNB` (grid dataset) with attrite of units and long name and decoded using decode function
 `/SWATHS/Brightness Temperature/M12/BrightnessTemperatureM12` from the HDFEOS root group (data field dataset) with its values
 `StructMetadata.0` (metadata dataset)

Extracting grid information
The script extracts the upper-left and lower-right coordinates of the grid from the metadata string.

Constructing the grid and plot
It constructs a 2D grid and creates meshgrid arrays for plotting. The data is then plotted on a cylindrical map projection specifying latitude of -90 to 90 and longitude of -180 to 180
with coastlines, parallels, and meridians added.
