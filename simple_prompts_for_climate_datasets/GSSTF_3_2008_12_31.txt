A Python script to visualize a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file. 

Here's how it works:
Reading the HDF File which is located at GSSTF_3_2008_12_31.he5

The script reads the HDF file. It navigates through the HDF hierarchy to reach the `Data Fields` group, the sub group is GRIDS and SET1, retrieves the `E` dataset.
Then it read its attributes such as units and long name and calls the decode function. It also reads fill value attribute from the 0th index of same dataset named E 

The by comparing the data and fill values it relaces it numpy nan value
After that it masked the E data using the numpy masked_array function with the parameters data itself and the result of numpy isnan of data

Since there are no latitude and longitude data in the data file, it should construct the longitude and latitude data based on the shape of the E dataset

Visualizing the Data
The script creates a map with cylindrical projection, sets up its boundaries (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range ), 
It also adds parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 120, and 30 with the labels of [1, 0, 0, 0].
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [0, 0, 0, 1] 

Step 4: Add Colorbar and Title
It also adds colorbar, then it adds pcolormesh with the parameters named longitude, latitude, data, latlon=True
