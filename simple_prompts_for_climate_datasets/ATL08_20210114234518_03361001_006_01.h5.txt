A Python code that reads an HDF5 file and visualizes the data on a map. Here's what the code does:

Step 1: Setting up
The code starts by defining two constants: `FILE_NAME` (the name of the HDF5 file) and `dset_name` (the name of the dataset within the HDF5 file, 
specifically `/gt1l/land segments/dem_h`).

Step 2: Reading data
The code opens the HDF5 file and extracts several datasets: `latvar` and `lonvar` (latitude and longitude variables) from the root group, 
and `datavar` (the main dataset) from the `/gt1l/land segments` group.

Step 3: Extracting metadata
The code extracts metadata from `datavar`: units, long description, and a special value for missing data.

Step 4: Handling missing values and masking NaNs
The code replaces missing values with `NaN`s and masks them using NumPy's functionality.

Step 5: Finding the middle location
The code calculates the middle latitude and longitude values from the extracted data.

Step 6: Creating a map projection
The code creates an Orthographic map projection centered at the middle location.

Step 7: Plotting data on the map
The code plots the data on the map, with color determined by the value in the `data` array.

Step 8: Adding details to the map
The code adds gridlines, coastlines, and labels to the map.

Step 9: Creating a colorbar
The code creates a colorbar for the plot, with a label indicating the units of the data.
