A Python code that reads an HDF-EOS5 file and plots BrO data against pressure. Here's what it does:

First, it imports necessary libraries.

Then, it defines two constants: `FILE_NAME` for the HDF-EOS5 file name and `path` for the dataset path within the file (`'/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO'`).

Next, it reads the HDF-EOS5 file and extracts various datasets:

BrO data from `BrO/Data Fields/BrO`
Pressure values from `/Pressure`
Time values from `/Time` from the sub path BrO/Geolocation Fields
starts with the path /HDFEOS/SWATHS

The code then plots the BrO data against pressure, customizing the plot by inverting the y-axis and setting it to logarithmic scale.
