Step-by-Step Explanation
The code reads an HDF5 file which is located at oco2_L2StdND_03949a_150330_B8100r_170916014809.h5 and creates a map with data visualization. Here's how it works:

Defining Constants
A constant `FILE_NAME` is defined as the name of the HDF5 file to be read.

Opening the HDF5 File
The HDF5 file is opened in read-only mode, and the file object is assigned to `f`.

Reading Data
Data is read from `/RetrievalResults/xco2` into a NumPy array `data`. The units and long name of the dataset are also retrieved.

Reading Geolocation Data
Geolocation data is read from `/retrieval_latitude` and `/retrieval_longitude` from RetrievalGeometry into NumPy arrays `latitude` and `longitude`.

Creating a Map
A map is created with a cylindrical projection, with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively. Coastlines, parallels, and meridians are drawn on the map.

Plotting Data
Data points are scattered on the map, with each point's color determined by its value in `data`. A color bar is added to the map with a label showing the units of the data.

Creating a Figure
A figure is created, and its title is set to include the HDF5 file name and dataset long name.
