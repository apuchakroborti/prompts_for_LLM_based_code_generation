Python code. Here's what it does:

Step 1: Import libraries
The code imports necessary libraries to interact with the operating system, create maps and visualizations, perform numerical computations, and read HDF5 files.

Step 2: Define constants
A constant `FILE_NAME` is defined as the name of the HDF5 file to be read.

Step 3: Open HDF5 file
The code opens the specified HDF5 file in read mode.

Step 4: Extract datasets
Three datasets are extracted from the HDF5 file:
	`latitude` and `longitude` from `/gt1l/sea ice segments` sub group
	`height_segment_height` from `/gt1l/sea ice segments/heights`

Step 5: Extract data and metadata
The code extracts the actual data from each dataset, as well as metadata like units and long descriptions.

Step 6-12: Process and visualize data
The code replaces missing values with NaN, creates a masked array, finds the middle location, creates a map projection, 
plots data on the map, adds gridlines and coastlines, customizes the plot
