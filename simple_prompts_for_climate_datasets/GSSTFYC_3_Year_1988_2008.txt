It reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file which is located at GSSTFYC_3_Year_1988_2008.he5. 

For reading data, it reads `SST` dataset from the sub group path /HDFEOS/GRIDS/NCEP/Data Fields
It then reads attributes from the SST dataset such as units and Long Name and decodes them using decode() function 
It also accesses the fill value of 0th index only from the SST dataset

Then by comparing the SST data and fill values it relaces the SST data by numpy nan value
After that it masked the SST data using the numpy masked_array function with the parameters data itself and the result of numpy isnan of data

Since there are no latitude and longitude data in the data file, it should construct the longitude and latitude data based on the shape of the SST dataset

Visualizing the Data
The script creates a map with cylindrical projection, sets up its boundaries (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range ), 
It also adds parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 120, and 30 with the labels of [1, 0, 0, 0].
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [0, 0, 0, 1] 

It also add pcolor mesh with parameters such as longitude, latitude and the SST data
