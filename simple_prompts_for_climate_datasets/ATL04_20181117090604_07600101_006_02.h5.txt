Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided code:

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining an HDF5 file named "ATL04_20181117090604_07600101_006_02.h5". 
It then opens the file in read-only mode.

The code accesses several datasets within the HDF5 file, including:

Latitude: `latitude`
Longitude: `longitude`
Height (dem_h): `dem_h` from root group profile_1

For each dataset, it retrieves the valid range from the dataset's attributes.
It read units and long name attributes from the Height dem_h data sets and after reading it decodes using ascii and replace

The code then uses a map projection to plot the data. 
It creates an equidistant cylindrical projection with a latitude range of -90 to 90 and longitude range of -180 to 180.  
and draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map. A scatter plot is created using longitude, latitude, and height values.

At the end, the code adds a colorbar and title to the plot, including the file name and long name of the height dataset.
