Python code that reads and visualizes ozone data from an HDF5 file based on the foloowing below description: 

It accesses the `/Data Fields` group and retrieves variables for `Profile Ozone`, `Latitude`, `Profile Pressure Levels`, and `Date`.
It reads ProfileOzone 3D data as a slice of 0th index of x-axis and all from both y and z axis data from the 3 dimensiontal array
It read units and long name attribute from the above mention datasets
it access the fill value data from the profile ozone data and by comparing with fill values it set NaN value
It also acces 0th index of the Date data

Next, it processes the data by converting the date to a string and applying a log scale to the pressure levels. 
Then, it creates a contour plot of the ozone data.

The plot is customized with a colorbar, labels, titles, and a text annotation displaying the date.
