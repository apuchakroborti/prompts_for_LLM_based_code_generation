Step 1: Setting up
The code starts by defining some constants, including the name of the HDF5 file to read.

Step 2: Reading data
It opens the HDF5 file and accesses a specific dataset called `cloud Water` from the group 'Grid'. 
the cloudWater dataset is a 3 dimensional data but take the 0th slice from x axis and all data from both y and z axis 
It reads the first slice of the 3D array and extracts the units of the data.

The code replaces fill values with NaN by comparing the main data from the dataset named cloudWater by comparing with the _FillValue data, 
It should then process the cloudWater data by checking where numpy data is nan and previously accessed cloudWater data. 

Step 3: Creating geolocation data
Since there's no geolocation data in the HDF5 file, the code constructs it manually by creating longitude and latitude arrays ranging from 
there are 1440 values for the longditude such as -179.875 -179.625 -179.375 ...  179.375  179.625  179.875
there are 720 valus for the latitude such as 89.875 -89.625 ... 89.375  89.625  89.875

Step 4: Setting up map visualization
The code creates a map object with a cylindrical projection and low resolution and latitude and longitude from -180 to 180 degrees and -90 to 90 degrees respectively. 
It sets the latitude and longitude limits to cover the entire globe.

Step 5: Drawing the map
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 91, and 45.
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [True, False, False, True] 

Step 6: Adding finishing touches
A colorbar is added with a label set to the units of the data, and the title includes the name of the HDF5 file and dataset path.
