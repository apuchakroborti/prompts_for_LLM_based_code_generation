a Python script. Here's what it does:
Reading an HDF-EOS File
The script reads an HDF-EOS file named `MOP03TM-201802-L3V95.9.1.he5`.

Accessing Data Fields
Within the `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields` group, it retrieves:

 A dataset named `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay`, which is assigned to `data`.
 The long name and units of the dataset from its attributes and then these values decoded using decode function.
 The fill value representing missing or invalid data.

Data Preprocessing
The script replaces values equal to the fill value with `NaN` and creates a masked array using NumPy's `ma` module.

Retrieving Geolocation Information
It retrieves two datasets: `Latitude` and `Longitude`, and creates a 2D meshgrid using NumPy's `meshgrid` function.

Creating a Basemap
The script uses the `Basemap` toolkit to create a cylindrical map projection with settings low resolution, specifying latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180. 
It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.

Visualizing Data
It creates a pseudocolor plot of the retrieved data on the map using Basemap, with settings like latlon coordinates and a colorbar.
