It starts by reading data from an HDF5 file named in the constant `FILE_NAME`. 
The file contains several datasets:
    from root gorup gt1l and the sub paths are `/latitude`, `/longitude`, 
    and `/h_li` from land ice segments group which contain latitude values, longitude values, and land ice height data respectively. 

The code then handles fill values in the `h_li` dataset by replacing them with NaN (Not a Number) 
and creating a masked array to exclude these values from further processing.

Next, it creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map with with a latitude range of -90 to 90 and longitude range of -180 to 180. 
The map includes coastlines, parallels, and meridians.

The code then plots the land ice height data on the map using scatter plot, where each point's color corresponds to its value. 

A colorbar is also created for the plot, labeled with the units of the data.
