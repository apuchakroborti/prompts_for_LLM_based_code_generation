I have an HDF5 file named "ATL20-01_20181101001332_05100101_004_01.h5" that contains several datasets. 
I want to read the data, extract attributes, and plot it on a map.

Reading Data
The file has three main datasets: 
    "/grid_lat", "/grid_lon", and "/monthly/meanfb". 
These contain latitude values, longitude values, and actual data values, respectively. I need to read these entire datasets into memory.

Extracting Attributes
From the "/monthly/meanfb" dataset, I want to extract attributes such as units, long name, and fill value.

Handling Fill Values
It should replace fill values with NaN (Not a Number) to the mean_fb dataset and create a masked array for efficient handling of missing values.

Creating a Map Projection
Next, It will create a Northern Polar Stereographic (NPST) map projection with a bounding latitude of 60° and central longitude of -45°.

Plotting the Data
I'll plot the data on the map, adjusting the longitude values by subtracting 180°. Then, I'll add coastlines, parallels, and meridians to the map.

Adding a Colorbar
Finally, I'll add a colorbar to the plot with units as the label. 
The resulting plot should show the data from the HDF5 file visualized on a map projection with a colorbar indicating the units of the data.
