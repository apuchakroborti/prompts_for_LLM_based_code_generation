Python code

First, I define two constants: `FILE_NAME` for the input file name which is located at OMI-Aura_L3-OMTO3e_2017m0105_v003-2017m0203t091906.he5 
and `DATAFIELD_NAME` /HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMIColumnAmount O3/Data Fields grid 
and dataset ColumnAmountO3 for the path to the dataset containing column amount of ozone (O3) data for the dataset path within the file.

Next, I open the file in read mode and access the dataset using the defined path. 
I then read the entire dataset into memory and handle fill values by replacing them with `NaN` and creating a masked array.

I also retrieve two attributes from the dataset: `title` and `units`, which I decode from bytes to UTF-8.
Since there's no geolocation data in the file, I construct it manually using NumPy arrays for longitude and latitude.

Using Basemap, I create an equidistant cylindrical projection with specified resolution and boundaries (such as -90 to 90 and -180 to 180). 
There is no geolocation data for this so, need to created longitude from -179.875 to 179.875 of 1440 values
and latitude of -89.875 to 89.875 of 720 values

I draw the coastline, parallels, and meridians on the map.
I then plot the data using `pcolormesh` with a specified colormap and lat/lon coordinates, adding a colorbar to the plot.
