a code that reads an HDF5 file and visualizes its contents. 
The code starts by importing necessary libraries.
It then reads a data file which is located at DeepBlue-SeaWiFS_L2_20101210T135954Z_v004-20130525T172725Z.h5, 
After that it access the dataset named `aerosol optical thickness 550 ocean`

Next, it reads latitude and longitude data. It also extracts the long name and units from the dataset named aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean decodes the value using the decode() function.

The code prepares the data for visualization by replacing -999 values with NaN
It then creates a masked data array using numpy masked array function with the parameters data itself and checking numpy isnan of the aerosol optical thickness 550 ocean data.

It then creates an orthographic map projection using mean latitude and longitude coordinates, 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 120, and 30.
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 

It creates a pseudocolor mesh plot of the data.
It add colorbar nad set label with a value the previously accessed units value
