I need help understanding a Python code snippet. 
Here's what it does:

The code starts by defining variables: `FILE_NAME` for an HDF5 file, and several others to store data from the file.

It then reads the HDF5 file, storing the 'l3m_data' dataset in `datavar`. 
It retrieves data minimum and maximum values, as well as a fill value, from the file's attributes.

The code processes the data by replacing fill values with NaNs and identifying invalid values outside a certain range. 

there are two other variables named units and long name and set the values psu and Sea Surface Salinity

then it compares the data with value and sets with numpy NaN value 
after that it creates invalid data with logical or with parameters such as comparision of data less than data minimum and data greater than data maximum

Next, it creates a map visualization using `Basemap`, defining x and y coordinates, creating a meshgrid, and setting up a cylindrical projection.
It also sets the resolution as low and latitude values from -90 to 90 and longitude values -180 and 180 
It adds coastlines, parallels, and meridians to the map, and plots the data as a scatter plot with colors represented by the 'jet' colormap.

It adds a colorbar with units, sets a title using the file base name and long name of the data
