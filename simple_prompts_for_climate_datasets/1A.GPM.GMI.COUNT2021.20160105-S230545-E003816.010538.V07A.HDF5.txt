A python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file. Here's what it does:

Step 1: Load Data
The script loads an HDF5 file and extracts several datasets:
	from the root group S2 it reads dataset 'solarAzimuthAngle' (solar azimuth angle) for the main data source 
	and for the geolocation data it reads from `latitude` and `longitude` (which are geolocation data) from the same root group S2
	Then it access two attributes named units and fill value from the main solar azimuth angle dataset

Step 2: Process Solar Azimuth Angle Data
It processes the solar azimuth angle data by replacing fill values with NaN and masking NaN values.

Step 3: Create Map and Plot Data
The script creates a map with projection named cylindrical map projection, sets up its boundaries (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range etc), 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 91, and 45.
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [True, False, False, True] 

Step 4: Add Colorbar and Title
Then it adds scatter values suchas longitude, latitudem data, cmap such as plt.cm.jet, no edge color and linewidth equal to 0, 
the colorbar location is bottom and the padding is 10 percent with the label units which is accessed previously from the main dataset solar azimuth angle
