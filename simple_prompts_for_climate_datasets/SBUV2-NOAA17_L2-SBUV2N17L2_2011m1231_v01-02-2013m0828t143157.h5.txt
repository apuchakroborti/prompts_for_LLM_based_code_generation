Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing necessary libraries.

Defining Constants
It defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read which is located at SBUV2-NOAA17_L2-SBUV2N17L2_2011m1231_v01-02-2013m0828t143157.h5

Reading Data
The script opens the HDF5 file and reads various datasets:
- `/SCIENCE_DATA/ProfileO3Retrieved`: 2D ozone profile data
- `/GEOLOCATIONDATA/Latitude`: 1D latitude values
- `/ANCILLARYDATA/PressureLevels`: 1D pressure level values
- `nTimes`: 1D time values in seconds since 1993-01-01

Data Processing
The script processes the ozone profile data by replacing invalid values with NaN, and creating a masked array.

Sorting Latitude Values
It sorts latitude values in ascending order.

Converting Time Values
Time values are converted from seconds to datetime objects.

Plotting the Data
A contour plot is created using latitude on the x-axis and pressure levels on the y-axis. The colorbar is labeled with ozone profile data units.

Customizing the Plot
The script customizes the plot by setting axis labels, adding a title, and annotating start and end times. It also inverts the y-axis, applies a log scale, 
and removes scientific notation from tick labels.
