a Python program that accesses and visualizes data from a SMAP L1A HDF5 file. 
The file contains radiometer data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission.

The program defines a `run` function that takes a file name as input, which is expected to be a SMAP L1A HDF5 file. 
It reads the file using HDF5, accessing datasets like 
`/moments16 right ascension`, 
`/moments16 lat`, 
and `/moments16_lon` from the root group HighResolution_Moments_Data

The program processes the data by identifying invalid points, setting them to NaN, and creating a masked array. 
It then retrieves geolocation data from the latitude and longitude datasets.

It then calculates invalid data using numpy logical or method using comparison with data greater than valid max and less than valid min 
Then the resulted invalid calculates again with parameters invalid and comparison with data and fill value
Then it sets numpy NaN values to invalid data
After that it creates masked array of data using numpy masked array and checking numpy isnan

For visualization, the program creates a Basemap object with a cylindrical projection, sets up the map boundaries such latitude values from -90 to 90 and longitude values from -180 to 180, 
and scatters the data points on the map using colors representing the values of the `data` array. A colorbar is added to the plot.
