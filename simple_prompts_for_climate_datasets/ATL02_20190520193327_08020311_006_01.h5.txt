Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to process and visualize data from an HDF5 file:

Step 1: Open the HDF5 File
Open the HDF5 file "ATL02_20190520193327_08020311_006_01.h5" in read-only mode.

Step 2: Read Data from HDF5 File
Read the following datasets from the HDF5 file:
extract latitude and longitude values into arrays from the subgroup /gpsr/navigation

`/bg_cnt_50shot_s`: extract elevation data, it also acces attibutes such as units and long name, 
then decode using decode function with parameters ascii and replace
`/delta_time`: extract time data into an array from the sub path /atlas/pce1/background

Step 3: Create Plots
Create two plots:

Plot 1: Time vs. Counts
Plot elapsed time against elevation data
Set x-axis label to "Seconds from <timedatum>" and y-axis label to the units of the elevation data
Set title to include file name, dataset name, and long name

Plot 2: Trajectory
Create a map projection with coastlines and gridlines
Plot the trajectory using latitude and longitude values
Annotate the starting point of the trajectory with a red marker and text

Step 4: Save the Plot
Save the plot to a PNG file named after the HDF5 file.
This process reads data from an HDF5 file, creates two plots (time vs. counts and trajectory)
