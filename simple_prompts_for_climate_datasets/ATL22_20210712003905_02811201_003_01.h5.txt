The code starts by importing necessary libraries for working with operating system functions, creating plots and visualizations, numerical computations, 
map projections, and HDF5 files.

Defining Constants
A constant `FILE_NAME` is defined which is located at ATL22_20210712003905_02811201_003_01.h5, which is the name of the HDF5 file to be processed.

Opening the HDF5 File and Accessing Datasets

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode and accesses three datasets: 
`/transectlat`, `/transectlon`, and `/inland waterbody type` from the root group gt1l. 
Each dataset is read into memory using slicing.

Handling Missing Data and Creating a Map

The code handles missing data by replacing it with `NaN` values, then creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map with a low-resolution with 
boundaries (such as -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 for the latitude and longitude respectively ) coastline database. 
The map is customized with coastline drawing, parallel and meridian lines, and a scatter plot of the data values colored according to their values.

Adding Colorbar and Title
A colorbar is added to the map, labeled with dataset units, and a title is set including the file name, dataset name, and long name.
