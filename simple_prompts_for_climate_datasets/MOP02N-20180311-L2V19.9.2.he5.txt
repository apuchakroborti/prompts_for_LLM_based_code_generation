File Input and Constants
We start by specifying the input file, `MOP02N-20180311-L2V19.9.2.he5`, which is stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.

Reading the File
The file is opened in read mode using a context manager to ensure it's properly closed when we're done.

Extracting Data
we extract data from the sub group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields` with the name of `RetrievedCOTotalColumn` dataset. 
We read its contents into an array called `data`, taking only the first column. We also retrieve the units and fill value attributes associated with this dataset.

Extracting Geolocation Data
We extract geolocation data from the `/Latitude` and `/Longitude` datasets from the sub group /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields, 
which contain latitude and longitude values, respectively.

Creating a Map
Using Basemap, we create a cylindrical map with low resolution, specifying latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180. 
We set the boundaries to cover the entire globe and draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map. 
Then, we create a scatter plot of the retrieved CO total column data using the geolocation coordinates.

Customizing the Map
We add a colorbar to the map, representing the units of the data, and set the title of the plot to include the file name and a brief description of the data.
